* **SQL (Relational DB)** vs
* **Graph DB (e.g., Neo4j using Cypher)**

### 🧩 Use Case: Find All Friends of a User

Imagine a **social network** where:

* Each user can have many friends (many-to-many relationship).
* You want to **get the names of all direct friends of a user named “Alice.”**

---

## ✅ 1. SQL Version

### 📌 Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE friendships (
    user_id INT,
    friend_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (friend_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

### 📌 Sample Query: Friends of Alice

```sql
SELECT u2.name AS friend_name
FROM users u1
JOIN friendships f ON u1.id = f.user_id
JOIN users u2 ON f.friend_id = u2.id
WHERE u1.name = 'Alice';
```

🧠 You’re joining the `users` table twice via the `friendships` table to get Alice’s friends.

## 🔁 2. Graph DB Version (e.g., Neo4j with Cypher)

### 📌 Data Model

* Users are **nodes**
* Friendships are **edges (relationships)** between nodes

```cypher
CREATE (a:User {name: 'Alice'})
CREATE (b:User {name: 'Bob'})
CREATE (c:User {name: 'Carol'})
CREATE (a)-[:FRIEND]->(b)
CREATE (a)-[:FRIEND]->(c)
```

### 📌 Query: Friends of Alice

```cypher
MATCH (a:User {name: 'Alice'})-[:FRIEND]->(friend:User)
RETURN friend.name;
```

🧠 In Cypher, you **traverse directly** from one node to another via a named relationship.

## ⚖️ Comparison

| Feature                      | SQL                     | Graph DB (Cypher)                    |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Data modeling                | Tables and foreign keys | Nodes and relationships              |
| Relationship query           | JOINs across tables     | Pattern-matching with arrows         |
| Performance (deep relations) | Slower as joins grow    | Faster with deep and recursive paths |
| Learning curve               | Low (common knowledge)  | Higher (new paradigm + graph theory) |
| Tooling and ecosystem        | Mature (ORMs, BI tools) | Still growing                        |

## ❗️What Can Go Wrong in Migration?

If your app is mostly CRUD or flat data (e.g., e-commerce, CMS), then graph DB:

* Adds overhead
* Makes devs learn a new language (Cypher)
* Requires rethinking everything from schema to indexing

So in such cases, replacing SQL might lead to this realization:

> "We replaced SQL with a Graph DB — then nothing made sense."
