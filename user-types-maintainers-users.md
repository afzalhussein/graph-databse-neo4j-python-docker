## Defining **two user types** with different responsibilities and relationship models:

---

## ‚úÖ Proposed User Types

### 1. **Social Users**

* **Purpose:** Regular users interacting with each other.
* **Relationship Type:** `:FRIENDS_WITH` (mutual)
* **Attributes:** `id`, `name`, `email`, etc.
* **Edge:** Mutual friendship edges.

**Example:**

```cypher
(:User {id: 'u1', type: 'social'})-[:FRIENDS_WITH]-(:User {id: 'u2', type: 'social'})
```

---

### 2. **Maintenance/Admin Users**

* **Purpose:** Administrative, operational, or moderator-level control.
* **Relationship Type:** Role-based access
* **Attributes:** `id`, `name`, `email`, `type='admin'`
* **Edges:** `(:User)-[:HAS_ROLE]->(:Role)-[:GRANTS]->(:Permission)`

**Example:**

```cypher
(:User {id: 'u3', type: 'admin'})-[:HAS_ROLE]->(:Role {name: 'moderator'})-[:GRANTS]->(:Permission {name: 'delete_user'})
```

## üîß Implementation in Neo4j Schema

```plaintext
(User)-[:FRIENDS_WITH]-(User)          -- for social connections
(User)-[:HAS_ROLE]->(Role)             -- for admin/maintenance
(Role)-[:GRANTS]->(Permission)         -- permissions for RBAC
```

## üß± Benefits of This Design

| Feature                      | Benefit                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Clear separation of concerns | Easy to manage social features vs admin tasks    |
| Extensible                   | Add more roles, permissions, or user types later |
| Graph model aligns naturally | Neo4j makes these relations fast and intuitive   |
| Security                     | Admin access doesn't leak into social space      |

## üõ†Ô∏è FastAPI Hint

In your `/users/me` endpoint, you could do:

```python
if user.type == "social":
    # Show friends, messages
elif user.type == "admin":
    # Show dashboard, manage users
```

---

Would you like me to generate:

1. Cypher schema setup for both types?
2. FastAPI Pydantic models and endpoints for these two user types?
3. Docker-ready example?
