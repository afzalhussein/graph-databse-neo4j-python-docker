## **mutual friendships** and **role-based permissions** solve **very different problems** in your system design. Here‚Äôs a concise comparison:

---

### ü§ù Mutual Friendships

**What it is:**
A **bidirectional relationship** between two users (e.g., User A is friends with User B **and** vice versa).

**Use case:**
Social networks like Facebook.

**Characteristics:**

* Must be **mutual** to exist (i.e., A is not a friend unless B also confirms).
* Usually managed with **two-way edges** or **"CONFIRMED"** states.
* Concerned with **user-to-user** relationships.
* Example logic:

  ```python
  MATCH (a:User {id: "A"})-[:FRIENDS_WITH]-(b:User {id: "B"})
  RETURN a, b
  ```

### üõ°Ô∏è Role-Based Permissions (RBAC)

**What it is:**
Users are assigned **roles**, and roles are assigned **permissions** to perform actions.

**Use case:**
Enterprise apps, dashboards, CMS systems, etc.

**Characteristics:**

* Focused on **user-to-system** authorization.
* Unidirectional: `User ‚Üí Role ‚Üí Permission`
* Separates **access logic** from business logic.
* Example logic:

  ```python
  MATCH (u:User {id: "123"})-[:HAS_ROLE]->(r:Role)-[:GRANTS]->(p:Permission)
  WHERE p.name = "DELETE_USER"
  RETURN u
  ```

### üîÅ Visual Analogy

| Feature              | Mutual Friendship      | Role-Based Permission            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Type of relationship | User ‚Üî User            | User ‚Üí Role ‚Üí Permission         |
| Directionality       | Bidirectional          | Unidirectional                   |
| Use case             | Social connections     | Access control                   |
| Stored in DB as      | Edge between two users | Two hops from user to permission |
| Examples             | Facebook, LinkedIn     | Admin panels, SaaS tools         |

### üß† Summary

* Use **mutual friendship** to model **social relationships**.
* Use **RBAC** to model **authorization** for actions and resources.

They serve **complementary** but very **different purposes** in a graph DB or FastAPI app.
